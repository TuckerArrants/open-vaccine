# open-vaccine

**A repository to store my notebook(s) for the [Kaggle OpenVaccine COVID-19 challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine).Please note that for some reason, the Jupyter Notebook will not render in my browser, so on the off chance that this is also the case for the user, please try to following hack: press on raw button and then go back. It should render now. If that doesn't work, you can download the notebook and upload it in your own environment.**
